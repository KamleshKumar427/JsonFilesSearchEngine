Dozen Police Officers In California Accused Of Trafficking And Raping Underage Girl In Complaint", "content": "A young girl was just 12-years-old when she was forced into the sex trade by pimps , then she went to the police for help but instead of aiding her , they proceeded to do the exact same thing to her later on in her life .\nThat \u2019 s not the shocking part according to the legal complaint more than 30 officers were involved and many were never punished .\nHere \u2019 s a refresher on the case which is several years old .\nIn 2016 , Celeste Guap claimed to have had sex with officers of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were when she was underage \u2013 just 16 years old .\nThe irony of all this , she was the daughter of an Oakland police dispatcher .\nGuap alleged that she had had sex with dozens of police officers from seven departments , including \u2014 Richmond , Oakland , Livermore , Contra Costa County and Alameda County .\nShe said some of her sexual encounters with officers happened while she was underage .\nSeveral officers were terminated as a result of an investigation , and several were charged criminally .\nHowever , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with six Richmond PD officiers as the Dailymail reports .\nIn exchange for the sex some officers gave her protection and tipped her off about undercover prostitution sting operations in text messages .\n\u201c A lot knew I was underage because they nicknamed me \u2018 juve , \u2019 which is short for juvenile , \u201d Guap said at the time .\nA sex scandal that started just involving the Oakland police department , has spread across east bay California to several police departments , including the Richmond Police Department , San Francisco Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than two dozen officers are implicated in the investigation that was started after Officer Brendan O \u2019 Brien committed suicide and left a suicide note that stated several officers lied in the first internal investigation about their relationships with prostitute Celeste Guap .\nO \u2019 Brien was one of two other officers accused of having sex with Guap when she was underage at 16 .\nO ` Brien is also suspected of murdering his wife \u2014 investigators called her death suspicious .\nFirst , the scandal caused police chief Shaun Whent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his officers were allegedly involved .\nA few of those other law enforcement officials were High-ranking Richmond police officers and five other officers who exchanged explicit messages with the teen .\nAll officers were reprimanded in writing however many kept their jobs , after being involved in criminal behavior that would get most people years in prison .\nWhat \u2019 s more , is the positions of power some of these officers held to protect children .\nFor example , former Lt. Andre Hill who was running the Richmond police department \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celeste Guap in 2015 .\nIn 2017 , two years later Hill was fired after it was discovered that for years , he sent the teen sexually explicit messages and engaged in oral sex with her at least once .\nHill was later fired for having oral sex with Guap at her home and sexting with her .\nBut Hill was never charged and is currently attempting to get his job back .\nFast forward back to 2020 , as part of a settlement agreement stemming from a lawsuit over SB 1421 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other officers \u2019 \u201c discipline \u201d were released .\nAccording to a report out of the Mercury News , Documents released by the City of Richmond on Wednesday indicate , of the 11 officers who were implicated in the sex scandal , three were kicked off the force , six were given letters of reprimand and two quit before being subjected to punishment , reported KQED .\nIf Hill being involved in the Youth Service Division and abusing a minor wasn \u2019 t enough .\nTan was issuing the police department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexted a trafficked teen .\nWhile at the same time simultaneously he was also involved in abusing her too .\nYou can not make this up !\nWhen another officer asked Tan about the messages , he had no problem admitting to them , saying \u201c Of course I made some comments because I \u2019 m a guy.\n\u201d Apparently being male excludes you from criminal charges of endangering and sexting with a minor .\nTan and Hill are among the highest-ranking officials in any of the departments and now we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News goes on to detail further officers involved .\nNone of the officers mentioned above by Mercury News were charged nor were they fired .\nThis is a monumentous problem that needs to be fixed .\nWhen the young girl went to police to get help for being trafficked by pimps , she was actually being brought into a depraved circle of cops from multiple departments who would continue to abuse her .\nAs the Washington Post reported , instead of helping her , at 17 more than 30 law enforcement officers \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exploit a teenage girl who needed to be rescued , \u201d according to a legal claim filed with the Oakland city attorney \u2019 s office .\n\u201c Instead of helping [ the teen ] find a way out of exploitation , they furthered and deepened her spiral down into the sex trade , \u201d the claim continued .\nThat \u2019 s not the end of it though , some of these officers were promoted after this incident as if it didn \u2019 t happen\u2026 The Oakland police department held a secret ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored several of the officers at the ceremony who were the same ones involved in covering up , mishandling , or otherwise participating in the sex-crimes against Guap .\nAs the East Bay Express reported at the time , two dozen protesters picketed the ceremony at the church \u2019 s entrance , accusing Mayor Libby Schaaf and the department of rewarding officers who should instead be punished .\n\u201c They seem to be resisting change , \u201d said Gwen Hardy , a longtime Oakland resident who has been involved in efforts to reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Express .\nHardy said the Coalition for Police Accountability , which spearheaded the creation of the city \u2019 s new police commission , met with Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick earlier this year .\nKirkpatrick told the activists she wouldn \u2019 t hesitate to discipline , and even fire , bad cops .\n\u201c But why promote them ?\n\u201d Hardy asked .\nRoland Holmgren one of the officers honored at the ceremony for his recent promotion to captain , was one of the dozens of cops referred to in a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mishandled the Celeste Guap case , in which multiple Oakland cops raped and trafficked a young woman and illegally accessed department records , among other crimes , according to the Express .\nSeveral other officers , including Capt .\nKirk Coleman who now runs the Internal Affairs Division were in attendance .\nColeman was also involved in the sex trafficking cover-up and named in the report for failing to notify the District Attorney about the criminal behavior of the officers in the case .\nThe public became aware of the investigation after Guap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive conspiracy to cover up the sexual abuse by dozens of California cops involved within multiple departments .\nThe question that needs to be asked is , how many other police departments are like this in big cities where crime rings run amok , trafficking children , or child trafficking is turned a blind eye ?\nWe know that at least one other department across the country in Miami turned a blind eye to the sickest most depraved child trafficker who ever lived Jeffrey Epstein .\nSo how often does this go un-noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the rug as if nothing happened ?", "author": "Adam Goldberg", "url":
